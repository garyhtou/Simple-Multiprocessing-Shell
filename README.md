## TODO:
- Single commands and the first command in a multi command works, but the second
  and subsequent commands will never exit.
	- This seems like a open file descriptor issue that prof brought up in class
- Command parsing needs to handle
  - strings
  - escaped characters (new line, escaped quote, etc.)
- Reach over the instructions/requirements again
- Run all test cases
- Generate new test cases
